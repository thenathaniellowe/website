		Has anyone told you today that you're enough? Because you're not. You're more than enough.
	</p>
	<p>
		Always have been, always will be. I was reminded of this because I’m eating your tilapia rn. Well in between typing and cleaning coconut rice off my keyboard I’m eating it rn. Hopefully this means your parents are enjoying your creation at the same time! Regardless, I mention it because the way you talk about your fish feels like the way you talk about yourself 
	</p>
	<p>
		“Well yeah it tastes good, but....”
	</p>
	<p>
		“Well I’m definitely not ugly, but...” 
	</p>
	<p>
		“I’m not dumb, but...” 
	</p>
	<p>
		“UCI isn’t a bad school or anything but...”
	</p>
	<p>
		Maybe it’s because you literally said that you don’t feel like you’re enough on Monday, but it’s something I’ve thought a lot about, and why, and how.
	</p>
	<p> 
		Why does someone so incredible in so many ways keep qualifying herself or her accomplishments?
	</p>
	<p>
		How is ANYONE supposed to feel like they are enough if someone so incredible in so many ways keeps qualifying herself or her accomplishments?
	</p>
	<p>
		The answers of course being what you said about yourself and your story on Monday, but it’s still puzzled me nevertheless. And the only thing I felt I could add is you really don’t have enough people around you who fully appreciate the complete human you’ve become and are becoming. I emphasize fully because I would assume most people aren’t outright shitting on you chica (if they are we need to talk and I need to know where they live and fuck em up). However, at the same time I feel like people cherry pick the aspects of yourself they prefer, and well imo that includes you.
	</p>
	<p>
		Each of those ^ is a direct quote from you, and I’m over here like... WTF the sentence should end before the “but.” You’re a package deal honey! You are everything and everyone you’ve experienced. You are the culmination of your struggles and triumphs. You are completely whole, whether or not you can accept that, as you are.
	</p>
	<p>
		You are enough because you are empathetic. Yes.
	</p>
	<p>
		But you are also enough because that empathy makes you hospitable in your current context.
	</p>
	<p>
		You are also enough because in your hospitality, you often have to deal with schmucks like me that try your patience.
	</p>
	<p>
		You are also enough because in that patience, you are able to emotionally compartmentalize and rant about shitty people who shall not be named to someone like myself or Nick, instead of to her which you and I both know you’d regret in the long run lol. 
	</p>
	<p>
		You are also enough because that emotional maturity also lends itself to emotional vulnerability, to which I attribute why you expressed wanting to lay hands on they who shall not be named. I mean if you actually did hit someone, we’d have a very different problem, but because you obviously didn’t it’s a really important sign to me. I can’t feel what you’re feeling, but when you express it I can at least be like “ok, alright now I know where you’re at.” I have friends whom I’ve known for four years that wouldn’t say that as raw, as down to earth as you would knowing me for four weeks. That’s not nothing, that’s a goddamn skill, and because of it you are enough.
	</p>
	<p>
		You are also enough because you are so down to earth, because you are genuine. You are the same human being today that was ecstatic to show me her fancy washer dryer combo the day I moved in. That’s not to say that you don’t grow, don’t evolve. It’s simply to say you are enough because you’re true to yourself at any given moment. You are your entire package at all times, you never leave part of yourself because you’re tired or you’re lazy or frustrated or upset. You just are.
	</p>
	<p>
		You are also enough because you get excited about shit like a washer / dryer combo in the first place lol. I meant it when I said you’re a content person, but what I don’t know if I expressed is that you’re an obviously content person. It exudes from you, it’s very natural. Maybe I had the advantage of meeting you in a no frills, business-motivated context, but UNLIKE SOMEONE, I didn’t stalk you before I met you. I hadn’t seen your IG, I hadn’t met your parents or Nick or Helen. All I knew was you, and clearly it didn’t take more than 5 minutes for me to see how beautiful contentment looks on you. When I see you get dressed up to make the same exact meal we made together for your parents, when I hear you say “I’m so nervous talking to my dad” ......
	</p>
	<p>
		to that I’m not going to say you LOOK prettier without makeup because that can just end up being insensitive, but I do genuinely PREFER it. Because tabling that discussion, you still look so much prettier when you look comfortable. You look prettier when you smile. You look prettier in Irvine. You look prettier enjoying omomo. You look prettier around Nick. You look prettier in a tshirt and shorts. You look prettier when you’re talking about your startup. You look prettier when you’re talking about biohacks and food science. You look prettier now that a certain individual has left your home. You look prettier when you cook tilapia and you look prettier when you cook dino nuggets. Admittedly, you also killed it with your fit walking out the door today haha. I just wish you looked as happy about the reason you dressed up as you do when you’re just being yourself. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Nothing you could do at this point could diminish your certain worth. Going to good colleges, doing good for your dad’s work, being gorgeous, pursuing real estate / content creation interests, etc. You could fail at all of that and it wouldn’t change the fact that you are already more than enough. You have nothing left to prove to anyone, including yourself. You are enough because of who you are, which is “pretty fucking dope.” Achievements are often the best vehicle to demonstrate that, but at the end of the day, no matter how many compliments you get, no matter how productive you were in your parents’ eyes, no matter how many people don’t appreciate what you do around the airbnb, no matter how much closer you’ve gotten to creating the career, family, or lifestyle that you want, you are still Michelle Kira Lee.
	</p>
	<p>
		You are you and always will be you. As dumbfuck as it sounds, be content with yourself. I promise I’ll be doing the same for me. Learn to give yourself the benefit of the doubt as you do with people who aren’t a fraction the human you are. I promise I’ll be doing the same for me. Accept that you are more than enough and have been for a really long time. I promise I’ll be doing the same for me. 
	</p>
	<p>
		No one said you had to be perfect to be perfect. I mean TECHNICALLY I have told you you’re perfect a few times lol, but in context that was to convey I needed you to stop thinking you had messed up and that I was doing a bad job of communicating my feelings. ANYWAYS, you are perfect in the sense you are exactly where you need to be. You didn’t take too long to graduate, you don’t need to find a “real” job rn, you don’t need to become a content creator by date x, you don’t need to make y amount in real estate to make it. You are perfect in the sense you are everything you need to be in the present moment and more.
	</p>
	<p>
		You once asked me how I’m able to say the things people want to hear, and I don’t believe that. I say what’s on my mind, but I try to feel what you’re feeling, and minimize that gap between what I can feel and what someone else is experiencing. Also understand that I have a distinct advantage in understanding you; I’m not invested in your success. You can completely fuck up all these things (pls don’t, but like if you do and need to start fresh just move to NYC with me lol) and it wouldn’t change the fact that you have been a great friend to me. Your parents might be disappointed, your boyfriend might want more, your best friend might expect different, and if that motivates you those are all genuinely good driving factors (within reason). But I’m sorry, I just can’t give a fuck if you’ve been nothing been kind and patient and compassionate to me. MY experience of you has been nothing short of 5 stars, 10/10 doctors would recommend friendship, 2 thumbs WAY up.
	</p>
	<p>
		Your story about the 2 days and dip guy who left you 4 stars could come across as petty, but like only if it wasn’t already clear how many fucks you’ve poured into making the experience at your home as good as you possibly could make it. Not that it matters, but you really deserve more appreciation. Not on Airbnb, but also that. Just in general, just in life. Maybe I’m actually just good at saying the first thing the “right” thing because no one else will just grow a pair and do it. Maybe you intimidate everyone with your awesomeness. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Or maybe I'm not good at anything. Did it ever occur to you it's really easy to make good art look like good art? I feel like I'm a museum tour guide, talking about Starry Night. Like yeah I can talk about how important it was to Van Gogh, how much it mattered to that era, art as a whole. OR I can just look at it and just be like.... that's fucking beautiful. It doesn't take a genius to realize you're a masterpiece, chica. The tour guide isn't the star of the show, you are. It's not that hard to find the right words about people who are doing all the right things. I truly believe you deserve better from everyone. Hopefully I can be one to contribute to that.
