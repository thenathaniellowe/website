		I'm a Piece of Shit
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm just not good at this, so I figured if I'm already working on my website I might as well use the time to mull over what you said anyways. Just FYI this (intentionally) doesn't navigate with the rest of my site, hence it's locked. Sorry about that.
	</p>
	<p>
		Yesterday I felt incredibly overwhelmed with our conversation, so I just wanted to take a step back the last day and a half (did a lot of Columbia stuff hehe), collect my thoughts in a way that hopefully now, hopefully here, are both clear, and genuine.
	</p>
	<p>
		With regards to Nick, I need to be more clear about what made me uncomfortable. I've deadass (in between coding sessions lol) been racking my brain over things we could do to celebrate finishing your classes that aren't heteronormatively suggestive. BTW you definitely said u were done on Thursday, you didn't tell me till Friday that it was just your HARD class done on Thursday. I hope you have time to study tomorrow/Monday. Anyways, I'm just trying to think of things that are fun and cheap. But if cooking evidently crossed a line, then I should probably cover every possible contingency, right? So let's make TRASH spam musubi, wrap them in PAPER (not fancy plates), and go on a PAVED hike. Are you down? Because I am! But I find myself spending more energy on not LOOKING like I'm trying to take someone's girlfriend than ACTUALLY not trying to take someone's girlfriend. Like... not hitting on you doesn't take a lot of effort, it's honestly p easy bc... well gross hahaha. But not hitting on you from HIS perspective, well that's a little tougher because understandably, a lot of people have broken his trust. But if he had these preexisting insecurities before I moved in and demonstrated them while I was here, just because you two had a conversation are either you or I gonna say he should get over them by now? I wouldn't, he's valid to feel those, but for me in stupid situations, such as I deadass just wanna hang out when you get back, that feeling of fault comes directly from there: having to adjust my behavior to someone's expectations because of something I never did and because of someone I am not.
	<p>
		And if he legitimately is 100% cool on everything, then none of what I just said matters. But remember, I haven't seen either of you since he was upset at me. You clarified everything over the phone after you were already in SD, so please pardon me but I'm naturally more cautious about setting off his alarms if I simply haven't seen him since he reacted this way last. Not that I don't trust what you said then, but to expect him to just let go of those insecurities, at least to the point that you can tell me "what does it matter what he thinks" or "you don't owe him anything," like yes I agree with both those statements but that doesn't mean I should just poke the bear. Just because he says he's cool now doesn't mean I don't want to try and avoid misunderstandings such as this. Just because he says he's cool now doesn't mean I don't really appreciate our friendship and I wouldn't want to jeopardize that because of something we're both already aware of.
	<p>
		With regards to Helen, I need to start by clarifying I was the one being an ass. I already apologized to her for my attitude, it was completely uncalled for, but I wasn't sure if I had told you that last night. I was mostly upset by two things she said, but I didn't take the time to express that so here: 
	</p>
	<p>
		1) She said "no one was blaming [me] for anything,"" which simply was not true. Heather had done so not two hours prior, which hurt me because it felt like that was being overtly dismissed. Yes, it would have hurt more had Helen been the one accusing me of something and to an extent I can brush things off Heather spews. That being said, it still sucked, especially since Heather had to lie to make said accusations and no one called her out on those lies either.
	</p>
	<p>
		2) She said "I'm only trying to figure out what happened," but immediately contradicted that by asking questions about the front door, air conditioning, other unrelated events. Is knowing that information important? Yes, of course. Thank you and thank her for that. But Helen tried to assuage my fear that I was being accused of something by specifically stating she just wanted context, but then proceeded to ask questions way beyond the scope of context. It was inconsistent and that frustrated me, but I did a poor job of communicating that I wasn't peeved by the questions themselves, I was peeved by the manner in which Helen had justified asking them.
	</p>
	<p>
		With regards to your Aunt, this is actually where I need to take an even deeper step back and be real with what I genuinely give any fucks about. When I first brought it up it was because it set me off, but with your response in mind, those frustrations i believe I have a better grasp on. This is now the third time I have explicitly said my comments about your Aunt do NOT pertain to Friday, 24th. When I first told you about it, I referred to the relevant situation, when we spoke over the phone I had to say again this is not with regards to the stove, and yesterday via text again you referenced your Aunt and the stove situation/conversation with Helen.
	</p>
	<p>
		And so with regards to you, I failed to bring this up when it happened, but now that this is recurring I can better materialize my feelings. It just hurts when I know people aren't listening to me. I expressed my trepidation towards your aunt, but you asked again on the phone and then again via text, and to this point I still don't know if you understand when I was referring to your Aunt.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is why it also hurts when you talk about the friends I invited because you mentioned that I never gave you a heads up last week and yesterday. Because I did tell you that my cousin was coming over on three different occasions. Based on your explanation both that day and yesterday, it was evident that you had either forgotten or zoned out for some chunks of our conversation. Far be it from me to guess which, but either way that really hurt my feelings. In case you don't remember, I didn't make YOU tacos, I made my cousin tacos but really wanted to share with you when things fell through. I didn't make YOU ramen burgers, I made my cousin burgers but wanted to show u the cool ramen buns when things fell though a second time. And during the first dinner we talked extensively about him, that he was supposed to come over, when he'd actually come over, his wife (albeit I did not mention she might come over, but she never came anyways), and the dolphins. I only mention the dolphins because again based on our conversation that day as well as yesterday, I am almost 100% confident you have no idea what I'm talking about. It hurts when parts of our conversations go unnoticed. It's not like I know when those moments are or arent, I just find out hours or even days later... oh i dont think she was listening to that. 
	</p>
	<p>
		All that to say I don't give any fucks about the situation itself anymore. In fact, just pretend I'm full of shit if that helps. I genuinely just don't want to talk about it anymore. When you asked me to bring you to the same page on this yesterday, I refused because quite frankly Kira, I don't owe you, and I don't owe anyone a second and third explanation (and/or fourth and fifth etc). It hurt to reexplain, rejustify myself; not because an opinion had changed, but just because I wasn't being heard. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I miss you a lot. I miss my friend who was supposed to move to irvine this week a lot, but now I'm not so sure she might get delayed. I miss my siblings and I miss my cousins a lot. I miss my best friend from Irvine whom I missed by a couple of days before I got here. I'm sorry all of this has been more than it needed to be, but I needed to be honest that these, among other instances, genuinely struck a sad chord for me. I just want to hang when you get back, do stupid shit or something. I want to just have fun for the last month or so I'll be in California (ever? maybe lol). I've been working my ass for so long, you've been working your ass for so long. I don't know what your goals for the rest of summer are but let's take it easy whenever possible yah? I like you a lot (NOT LIKE THAT LOL), you're a really cool cat. Let's be real I wouldn't give a fuck if you weren't. But can we just stop with the going back and trying to figure things out? I trust you, so I hope you trust me when I say I just can't give a fuck anymore hahaha.
