		My website is ready to add content and push to source at some point today/tonight, so I wanted to include an inaugural entry here for you!
	</p>
	<p>
		The first week I was here, we were making dinner and you asked about my day on a scale of 1-10. I asked if it was okay on a scale of 1-5, just out of instinct. Such an auxiliary, yet fond memory from college, I had this one friend that would ask pretty much every week how my day/week was on that scale. We’d hi-five our 5 days, deconstruct the 3s and 4s, and console each other on our 1s and 2s. 
	</p>
	<p>
		My brother’s favorite number is 5.
	</p>
	<p>
		I had a family of 5.

	<p>
		My five favorites (in no particular order, except for Ang. She is actually #1):
	</p>
	<p>
		Angela, Ang - She’s my best friend. She’s also my sister, but tbh that part doesn’t matter as much to me. I mean obviously it does because it’s WHY we know each other, but in terms of HOW we know each other, we can talk about anything. From shooting the shit to recent shootings, we can open up to each other about our least and most personal or emotional experiences. She’s the first person I think about whenever I NEED to talk to someone about something. I know I can come to her in any state, angry, sad, silent, chischis (sorry not sure how to say this in English lol) and she won’t take it personally. I miss her very much. She is in Texas rn.
	</p>
	<p>
		Kenny, Kenis- He’s my closest family member (outside of nuclear). He’s always stuck around Irvine/OC while I was growing up, so even when I wasn’t I could always come back or visit. We both got really close after we found out the other smoked. We’re both pastor’s kids, our parents even worked together for over a decade. It was just something that never occurred to the other person even though we were both pretty avid. Something about the camaraderie of shared hardships, growing up in conservative Christian homes, hurts in the church itself, turning to similar behaviors to cope with them, it sucked but it was at least nice to have someone to hear those hurts. I’m 7 years younger than him, so I wasn’t mature enough to have these conversations with him until the last 2 years or so. But nevertheless I’m still really grateful for him as a brother.

	</p>
	<p>
		Peter - My best friend from Berkeley. Neither one of us really remembers how we met, but we were in a school club together and at some event we must’ve started watching or talking about a basketball game. My life is a story, and he must be my foil. We have similar experiences obviously, attending the same school and clubs etc., but to me he’s everything I am not in a friendship (and hopefully vice versa). He’s level-headed when I am not, patient when mine runs thin, smart in areas I can’t comprehend, compassionate towards those I fail to empathize with. He’s seen me through probably my absolutely lowest. He’s seen me get into fights, helped me get out of said fights, seen me drunk out of my mind, making mistakes, fucking relationships up, self-harming, self-destructing. I am just happy he stuck around long enough to see me clean up, go back to school, and now we’re gonna be < 30 minutes away from each other in NY.
	</p>
	<p>
		Jacqueline, Jacky, Jack, JackJack, J, JT, JQT, chica (she goes by anything honestly) - My best friend from high school. We’re not as close anymore, but she’s also in New York and we reconnected for the last couple of years since I decided to apply. I just really really respect her. She’s also been there through everything Peter saw, although maybe not as up close and personal since we went to different schools. She makes me feel really positive about myself. For example, when I told her I was moving to New York, she was the happiest asian “mom” ever. She screamed at me over the phone for like half a minute and had me read her my acceptance letter, and we talked about how far apart we’d be, our favorite NY desert/drink spots etc. It was awkward as hell (the phone reading part), but like it was so sweet to make someone, anyone proud of me for once. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Kira, Michelle, Michelle Kira Lee, beautiful, chica - Maybe it’s just a product of where I’m at right now. I moved away from the last 5 years of my life, said my goodbyes (except Peter), had to cut out my parents, and this past week my brother and I mutually decided we’re both better off apart given our family situation. It’s just too messy rn and we don’t need each other, as much as it sucks, knowing we can grow healthier, stronger, faster if we’re not in each others’ lives. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Maybe it’s purely circumstantial, but I really like, respect, and trust you. Not everything/everyone gets into my top 5 the same way, I like pork belly and New York for very different reasons (even if they’re both scrumptious). Again, I wish you had just... grown up in Irvine LOL because then maybe, just maybe we could’ve gotten close in an actual life context. But ya know what? You didn’t and that’s life. I wish I could’ve gotten to know everyone at a time in life that was convenient, extenuated, appropriate, but I’m still grateful for everything I have now. I met you because of a negative situation in my life, in an airbnb, during a pandemic, while you were still taking classes, moving back and forth between home and home, still deciding on a career path, etc etc etc. Life’s never what we expect or want, but through all that bullshit, I still really like, respect, and trust you. Yo

	<p>
		I wish I could like, respect, and trust you because we were close, but that isn’t the case. That being said, I share things and speak to you like that were the case because I still see so much genuine, and precious beauty in your character. The world could really use more of you, like maybe 6? 1 per continent. Imagine how much better the world would be with 6 more Kiras. Like... at least 7x. Math. LOL. But again, I’m okay with all of that. I’m okay that I can just really appreciate you, almost from afar. I mean really from afar once I move, but technically rn I’m still in your house.
	</p>
	<p>
		Again, maybe it’s all circumstantial, but if not mine you deserve to be one someone’s top 5, so why not mine for today? You’re all time great material. You’re very precious and I hope I’m not the only one to tell you that today.
