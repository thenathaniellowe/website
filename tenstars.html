		I deadass have rewritten this 3 times now because I don’t want random people on Airbnb to think I’m in love with you or something hahaha. This is your ACTUAL review. 
	</p>
	<p>
I hope that I have done my due diligence in expressing to you how much of a fan of yours I have become over the past month and a half. A fan. A fanatic. Like... a crazy person. You’re so wonderful that I can’t help myself. If Airbnb asks me for my opinion about you, I have to hold back, or else I’ll start to gush. And gush you bet your ass I’m about to.
	</p>
	<p>
I’m very grateful that you helped me get onto the plane today, it was tough. You can’t make my time in Irvine that enjoyable, that wonderful, and be like “ok now leave,” and not expect me to be sad. New York is supposed to be the greatest city in the world, but I’m starting to think it’s only that when you’re here. GAWD i am such a simp rn, also yesterday HAHAHA. But in all seriousness, I was concerned I wouldn’t make it. Last night was easily the most difficult I had in Irvine, in socal in general. I was thriving in Berkeley for a reason, and while I eventually needed to come back down, I quickly remembered how challenging a place socal has always been for me. 
	</p>
	<p>
I spoke to my sister when I arrived at the airport and she commended me for a lot of things that I felt was unnecessary, pandering if you will. But as we got to talking she helped me remember that this has been a long time coming. She wasn’t proud of me because I literally got to an airport, she was proud of me for writing my application essay. She wasn’t proud of me because I literally got to an airport, she was proud of me because I was taking something that legitimately hurt me, my living situation, and turned it into fuel to move across the damn country. She wasn’t proud of me because of me because I literally got to an airport, she was proud of me because I wanted this and I made it happen.
	</p>
	<p>
Why’d you spend a whole paragraph talking about your sister, this is supposed to be for chica? Well cause honestly I hope we can continue to be friends like that, siblings of sorts. In the community I grew up in, it refers to someone in endearment, even if literally just means “girl.” I dunno, not a lot of women also get to be chicas (or guys chicos), but I pretty much always wanted to be close to you. I don’t remember immediately calling you chica, like the first time/week we met, but at some point it must’ve slipped out without me realizing it. I feel like we keep saying we aren’t usually THIS OPEN with people THAT QUICKLY, but evidently, very early on, I was ready to trust you, chica.
	</p>
	<p>
You and my sister are so different I can’t really compare you two directly. The reason I wish I had a 3rd sibling like you in light of that is because I can and do behave around you two similarly. I am much more... gay around chicas than my normal crew, and especially my parents (obviously). I like dick around chicas a lot more than I care to admit in front of others LOL. It’s nice to have someone in the family or at the Airbnb I’m more true-to-self around, an ally. You asked if I care if people know I’m bi, and this is part why yes, part why no. Yes, I want people like you to know because it’s part of who I am around you. But, no I don’t want people who toss in the prejudice to know(or just my parents in general). I’d rather just not go through that conversation, so I am hyperconscious about my behavior. I am definitely my most self around people like my sister and you, and I love you for that. You’re both very lovely, very lovable, and very loving. I need a lot of all of that rn. I need people I can make food for, but I also need people who pick up the phone when I don’t value my life enough. I can always turn to my sister after a bad date and be like “men are shit!” and she can be like “I know! fuck men.” I need someone to talk about pussy with, I also need someone to lust after dick with hahahaha. You both embrace my duality, the challenge of understanding me. 
	</p>
	<p>
Inevitably, being my most self also leads to days like last night. I feel so sorry for allowing that to reach you, it was an incredibly dark place and I hope you never have to see that again. That being said, if/when it does, I hope you can still be there for me. Because as awful as I feel for letting you know where I was at, I knew I could trust you. I spoke to my sister right before we called, I hope that’s a positive indication to whom my mind goes when I’m profoundly sad. 
	</p>
	<p>
I love you in a very special place in my heart, and by special I quite literally mean you are one-of-one in that place. Yes, all chicas I love in a brotherly way, but I feel I got a front row seat to your life, and vice versa. I feel like we both left everything at each other’s feet (I mean if you’re secretly a jerk lmk asap so I can unfriend you immediately lol) and were just like... here, take it or leave it. That’s why last night happened, because in front of 99% of people I’m too scared to be honest. I’m terrified of telling you those things and yet I still did, because goddammit if I go down so long as you’re a part of my life. That’s not to say I should just off myself if we never spoke again, it’s just a testament to how much more I trust you than pretty much everyone but my sister, cousin, and one other friend (jack jack). I met you in a uniquely opportune place in (my) life, wherein I literally couldn’t give a fuck. I wasn’t expecting to make any friends ever since I came back for Christmas knowing I’d be out of here in the fall. These last 8 months I was resolute in hunkering down for New York, which knowing me, was obviously kind of difficult. But all the scathing fall outs, parents included, also reminded me I need someone. I don’t HAVE a lot of people in my life even if I KNOW a lot of people in my life. I was ready to restart that in New York where the people and the culture and the pace would be more conducive, both to my strengths and weaknesses.
	</p>
	<p>
But goddamnit you fell out of the sky and were like... fucking awesome. I wasn’t even supposed to need your place, but things turned so sour at home that necessity presented something, someone I will never forget. You were literally an hour away from possibly never meeting me. Had I talked to my sister first instead of my brother I might’ve ended up in Austin. He told me he thought Irvine would be best for me, so I just did literally everything he told me to do. I was so done at the time trying to figure out life, so when he offered suggestions I was just like “keep it coming!” Tell me where to live, what I should do about food, transportation, call a ride for me, pls I just want to be a kid without stress for a summer again. I would’ve done whatever anyone told me at the time, I was in such a toxic and abused head space I couldn’t think (positively) for myself. So yeah, had my sister been free before my brother (he’s east coast, she’s central time, so super glad he woke up before her), who knows?  
	</p>
	<p>
But now that today is 08.24 who gives a fuck? We already met! So instead of talking hypotheticals, I can just talk about what I do know.
	</p>
	<p>
I know that you and i would’ve gotten along had we met at any time in my life. Maybe not at any time in your life, but that’d be cool if also that. If we click now, there’s something(s) inalienable about you as a person that is/are attractive, inviting, sexy, empathetic, humble, homey. You have grown so immensely over the past month and a half since we met. You have grown so immensely over the past 8 months or so as you’ve been learning to operate your Airbnb. You have grown so immensely over the past couple years since you returned to school. You have grown so immensely since and because of the time you took off. You have grown so immensely since the day you first moved to Irvine for school. It doesn’t take a stats major to extrapolate... that you have always been growing into the person who intersected lives with me in 2020. I’m so happy we met now as opposed to never, please keep intersecting. You should visit New York like... all the time. And then move there like... forever.

I know I had a better time with you than I would have had literally anywhere else. You might not have the best Airbnb on the planet with the most amazing amenities, but you alone made my time a treat. I had a summer, an actual summer, for the first time since middle school? That plus I also just really liked the loft, it’s easily my favorite room in the house. I mean fair, I never lived in the others, but as a concept I think I took more advantage of it than I’d ever, say a front door. Certain things, like watching movies on a big screen, late night private phone calls with you on the balcony, can’t be advertised. You can’t put that on your listing, but goddammit if you aren’t the best part of 43 Secret Garden. It’s night and day when you’re around. 
	</p>
	<p>
I know that you have voices in your head, just like me. Yours are just literal. Incredible people don’t eat up wrong opinions about themselves unless they’ve been fed some bullshit. Think about it, you’re amazing. If all you did was look at yourself, unadulterated, all you would see is yourself, which is amazing. You’d see yourself the way I see you. But conversations like we had Saturday about your father happen. I know you don’t think of yourself as an idiot, but don’t tell me that, among probably worse things he’s done/said, doesn’t still influence you. He’s your dad, you better care about what he says. You don’t have to embrace bullshit to still internalize it in the way you think about yourself. I have never lied to you, so even if you aren’t as verbally expressive, you’d still already know how precious you are. The fact that you don’t makes it all the more important that I say it.
	</p>
	<p>
I know I’m going to miss you like hell until you definitely come visit me hehe. I’m going to miss bumping into you in the kitchen. I’d often find some bullshit to do in there, like rearrange the freezer I just rearranged or fill an almost already full glass, just cause I didn’t want to start talking to you with no reason to be in there. Eventually I’d just walk up and say hi obviously, but that story is just to say I genuinely appreciate your company. I’m going to miss studying with you in the common space. Admittedly I did very little studying and a lot of coding while you were around, and I have no idea what you were doing at the kitchen table, but again, your company is just really pleasant. What you talked about missing that quintessential college vibe/experience, I miss that too. Granted, I’m still in the thick of it, but I get why that matters to you. I’m going to miss hearing your voice just around the house. I don’t have 4 walls, so I just hear a lot of everyone’s voices, if not their words. You spent so much time complimenting my voice you seemed to downplay when I complimented yours. I dunno if timbre or range is a determining factor for me, I just like the words you say. I just like hearing your voice when I’m happy, when I’m sad, when I’m confused, when I’m frustrated, when I’m alone, when we’re both in the house. You have such a reassuring presence, maybe that just extends to your voice. I’m going to miss how caring you are for your home. I can always know that about you, but to see it in action is a privilege. Seeing you in all your beauty, in all your splendor, it’s a treat. I’m sure there are other ways you express it outside of the home, but I didn’t meet you like that so I take what I can get. I love how homey you are. I love how content you are. I love how much you like air conditioning and washing machines. I’m going to miss your contentment in my life, it’s infectious. It doesn’t just stick with you, it puts others at ease. Can you imagine what it would be like for me if my own host wasn’t content with her home? I see that you love it, I see that you take such good care of it, I see how much it hurts so much when others disrespect it, I see you in all of that. I see how beautiful contentment looks on you, and I know I say that a lot, but it’s the truth. I’m going to really miss your smile. I told you this already, but seeing you last week show up a day early, even without chatting, made my day. That was the start of the thoughts and the pain that built up to yesterday’s meltdown for me, so obviously I needed a win. You were that win. For 5 seconds the world seemed a little less dark because your face was in it. I just needed something to surprise me and then you were there. Your smile brought me so much joy, and will continue to do so until you stop smiling, which better be never. I’m going to miss cooking with and for you. It’s so important to my life, I was glad to share with you. I’m going to miss running errands with you. I’m going to miss the conversations we had on those grocery runs. I’m going to miss constantly learning new things about you, constantly being wowed by you, constantly being captivated by your words, your presence, your beauty. I’m sure we’ll keep up, but it’s different and we both know that.

We were both blessed to have this really stupid times in our lives, because as stupid as the bullshit you’re putting up with is, as stupid as the bullshit I’m putting up with is, we both needed a break from the bullshit. I’m so glad you were that break for me. Thank you for not being a piece of shit, but also thank you for just being incredible. Thank you for being the last person in California I ever want to meet. Thank you for listening, thank you for keeping the conversation going. Thank you for answering my ceaseless questions, thank you for throwing them back my way. Thank you for your home, thank you for being home. Thank you for sharing your struggles, thank you for being there for mine. Thank you for sharing some of my life circumstances, thank you for being so uniquely yourself at the same time. Thank you for having the right words to say at the right times, thank you for having he right words to say at the wrong times. Thank you for being vulnerable in your brokenness, thank you for showing me how much more complete you are because of it. Thank you for letting me be your friend, and above all, thank you for being mine.

I cried last night because I thought I might hurt myself. Now I’m crying on my (thankfully empty) flight because some goodbyes are harder than others. I think the literal goodbye wasn’t so bad because we were both in rushes to different places, but emotionally... I miss you rn. fuck... please don’t be a stranger to the city.
	</p>
	<p>
I love and care about you in a depth of my heart that prior, I had not explored. I have enough love for everyone in my life, but not necessarily my Airbnb host. You kind of inserted yourself into my life, and for that I am so grateful. Thank you for being someone I had to love. Thank you for being everything you need to be. Thank you for being you Kira. I miss you very dearly, and I’m going to New York. I miss you very dearly, and I’m on the way to see the love of my life. I hope New York doesn’t get jealous when you visit. To be honest, you’re a lot prettier too.

P.S. FUUUUUUUUCK WE LANDING! I gotta finish and proofread real quick because this deadass took me almost the entire flight, minus a short nap in the beginning, to finish. I hope you know I spend a lot of time writing to you, because quite frankly, you’re indescribable. I’m using inherently inadequate words to describe one of the most precious people in the world. I hope you have no idea how amazing you are, because knowing that would imply you are fathomable. I’m perfectly content being inadequate complimenting you because it’s not like I could ever be successful at it anyways. I love failing to capture your beauty, your intricacies, your growth, because it reminds me we’re still month and a half friends. No matter how close we do/don’t get, I can’t speed time up. I’m excited because that means there’s still so much more to learn about you. I miss you so much, please come this winter, holidays would be grand if possible, but you already knew that. Let me be the host this time. I’m so sick and tired of seeing you stressed out, it’s infuriating. You deserve better, from the world and from others. But until and even when that happens I will always be there to remind you, chica, you’re so beautiful in every way I could waste words on.
